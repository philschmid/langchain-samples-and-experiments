# Langchain samples and experiments

This repository contains sample code and experiments using [LangChain](https://langchain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), a Python framework for building applications powered by large language models.

## Introduction

LangChain provides tools and abstractions for:

- Connecting to large language models like GPT-3, Llama 
- Retrieving knowledge from datasets
- Constructing sequences of model interactions 
- Persisting state across model interactions
- Logging and streaming model interactions

With LangChain you can quickly build prototypes and POCs to explore how large language models can add value to an application.

## Get Started

To start using LangChain:

```
pip install langchain
```

## Examples
